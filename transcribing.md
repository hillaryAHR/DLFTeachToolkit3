# Introduction to Transcribing Documents
Why do we transcribe documents? On one level, transcribing something allows you to become intimately familiar with the contents of a document. Furthermore, transcribing makes physical documents, especially handwritten documents, machine readable. In other words, it allows computers to recognize text, which gives researchers more potential to analyze and use that text for digital scholarship. Think about it -- scanned letters are pictures of text, which is something a machine cannot translate. Even though there are programs that can attempt to read handwriting (like Transkribus) and even typed text, computers aren't smart enough to read things humans are!

Transcribing something bridges the gap between reading a document, and storing a picture of one.
***
In this module, you will learn to:
- Transform an archival, primary source document into a machine-readable file with a transcribing software (Transkribus)
- Add metadata tags to a primary source document, and understand why doing so enriches the file, enhances discoverability, and creates opportunities for further research
- Use a tool that allows for group project management, like Asana or Microsoft Teams, by tracking progress and communicating with group members synchronously and asynchronously
- Create different file types from transcribing and tagging a letter and understand their purposes (.txt, .docx, .xlsx., and .pdf)

## Before you begin:
Every person has preconceived beliefs that affect how they think and act - this is true for documents created by people a long time ago and for us, reading those documents. Those beliefs, or “bias,”  can sometimes contribute to the misinterpretation of information, and can skew characterizations of the content.  In reading these documents, be aware of potential biases that exist, and your own bias that might come into play as you transcribe and annotate the document with tags. Try to remain objective when assigning tags by following classification standard schedules, and when there’s room for interpretation, to remain as objective as possible to preserve the integrity of the original materials being described.

## Installations
- [Transkribus](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/?sc=Transkribus): Installation Instructions [here](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/wiki/download-and-installation/). (Be sure you have Java 8 installed before installing Transkribus. This is in the instructions, but not in the first step.) Transkribus Lite is the browser-based version of this, but as of this writing is still under development. We recommend downloading the free desktop version of this software.
- Project management: There are several browser-based options to keep track of your progress and communicate with team members the documents that you are working with. These tools can help keep multiple moving parts of a project in sync like keeping track of supplies, correspondence, and tasks needed to make it to completion:
    - [Asana](https://asana.com/) - for organizing and assigning tasks as well as mapping them out in a timeline to track progress and milestones.
    - [Trello](https://trello.com/) - allows you to visualize the tasks and focus needed, through lists and cards, to complete the project
    - [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L0EskmqzYTHwwZOxsRCGfEksq9m2i6UXDIha77SNKa4/edit?usp=sharing) template for transcribing (make a copy of this template to edit it) - similar to Asana and Trello in mangaging tasks, but in a spreadsheet format that allows for collaborate editing

# 1. Transcribing Guidelines

In order to maintain the integrity of your original document while you are translating it for the computer, consider a few things while you're transcribing.
## Stay as true to the document as you can!
- Include all text as it is written. This includes errors in spelling and grammar, and words you might not be familiar with. **Transcribing is NOT editing!**
- If there are images in the text, describe them in brackets (e.g. "[doodle of a curly-haired smiling face]").
Keep it simple! You want people to be able to read the transcription without looking at the original letter. Your transcriptions will be plain text files (e.g. files with no formatting), so, without editorializing, keep the text readable as possible.
## If you have trouble reading the text...
- Take a break and come back. Fresh eyes make a difference!
- Try to read the words in context. The word might look like "fhe," but it doesn't make sense to read "And then fhe called her sister." You would realize the word is "she."
- Ask for help. Send a screenshot to your classmates in your project management group or post it to a social media account for a second opinion.
- If you've tried all these things, and it's just not possible to figure out, write [illegible] in brackets and tag that text with the "gap" tag (more on tags in section IV!).
## Take notes while you are transcribing
- Make note of things you don't understand, and Google them to see if you can make sense of the reference.
- You might find something interesting that you want to come back to! Take notes of the letters you transcribe, and what you find interesting about them.

While it is long, we recommend watching [this video](https://youtu.be/-cDD9P0rnLw) of transcribing a letter from start to finish. Feel free to follow along in corresponding sections!

## Remember you’re doing this as a team
- Use your project management tools to mark your progress and note what you need to go back to later

![screenshot of Asana](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/asana-screenshot-track-progress.JPG)
- Communicate with your team what you’ve done and what you need help with through notes and comments. Tag or notify people if something else needs addressing.

![screenshot of task in Asana](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/asana-screenshot-make-note.JPG)
- To track your progress, you can create an account, or you can copy [this project management template in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L0EskmqzYTHwwZOxsRCGfEksq9m2i6UXDIha77SNKa4/edit?usp=sharing) for your own use.
## Check-in
Practice transcribing a few lines, staying true to the original text with the sample excerpt:

![SonnyBoy letter screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/sonnyboy-letter-screenshot.JPG)

Compare transcriptions and decide what the ideal transcript would look like.

Fill out your project management tool (using either [the template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L0EskmqzYTHwwZOxsRCGfEksq9m2i6UXDIha77SNKa4/edit?usp=sharing) or a chosen app) with the items you have to transcribe, and share the list with your groupmates.

# 2. Text Regions in Transkribus
Before we get started actually transcribing, we have to tell Transkribus what parts of the page have text on them, and what order to read that text! (Remember, computers aren't smart enough to read like humans!) The following is a basic step-by-step for the most common kinds of errors you’ll correct. 
A full documentation of the Transkribus layout tools is [here](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/howto/how-to-transcribe-documents-with-transkribus-introduction/#elementor-toc__heading-anchor-3)
 
The text regions we will work with are:

The page (or "text region"), where text is: 

![text region screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/text-region-screenshot.png)

The line of text, or line region, reads as a left-to-right: 

![line screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/line-screenshot.png)

And the baseline, the most important reference point for text recognition, runs along the bottom of the handwritten text line. The letters should sit on the baseline as it underlines the words themselves:

![baseline screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/baseline-screenshot.png)

If you make changes on lines, it is important to always do it on the baselines. This is important to know because for every line in your document, there is also a line region in the background.

## Run a Layout Analysis
Before we can ask Transkribus to read the handwriting, we have to ask it to identify the text regions for us. The quickest way to do this is to run a layout analysis on the document, then correct any mistakes that Transkribus makes. Here's how you run the analysis:

1. Double click the document you’ve uploaded, and click on the Tools tab.
2. Under Layout Analysis, make sure you’ve selected all pages.
3. Click Run

![layout analysis screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/layout-analysis-screenshot.png)

4. A notification that the layout analysis is in progress will pop up. After a few moments (between 3 and 10 seconds), the layout (green squares, blue rectangles, and dark blue lines) will appear over the letter’s text.

![Transcribing progress](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/transcribing-progress.png)

5. Correct errors in the layout (e.g. delete text regions or lines that don’t cover text, resize regions that cut off text, reorder line numbers, or merge lines that have been split). Screenshots of example corrections:
    - Delete text regions that don't actually contain any transcribe-able text.
    
    ![no text layout error screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/no-text-layout-error.JPG)
    
    - This layout analysis split a line in two, and needs merging. (Sometimes, though less frequently, it will merge something that should be two lines. For this, use the scissor tools above the merge tool.) Holding control, click each region that needs joining (usually the baseline and the line) and then click merge. 
    
    ![merge error screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/merge-error-screenshot.png)
    
    - Sometimes the software will number things in a different order than we'd actually read them. Click on the eye in the top toolbar, and select _show lines reading order_. If the lines are out of order, click on the numbers to change them. 
    1[line reading order screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/line-reading-order-screenshot.JPG)

## Check-in

What do you do if Transkribus has created text regions where there isn’t any text?

What do you do if Transkribus has split one line into two (or more) lines?

What button do you click on if Transkribus has ordered the lines in a different way than they’re actually read?

Discuss: what is the purpose of layout recognition? Why does Transkribus need to know where text appears and what order lines are read in any way?
# 3. Handwritten Text Recognition
We are using the Transkribus software because it allows you to create Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) models. This tool works with mixed results, depending on the quality of your letters and the style of handwriting. In this lesson, you will see the use of an HTR model that has had 2 years of training and different iterations, and is based on ~100 transcriptions. While there are models for different time periods and nationalities already in Transkribus, you may find that the algorithm does not work with your dataset as well as it should. We’ve provided a sample letter to use with the “Pauline 2.0” HTR model, but you may choose a different HTR model depending on what you need to transcribe. A full step-by-step guide for training and using HTR models is linked on Transkribus’ website [here](https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/howto/how-to-train-a-handwritten-text-recognition-model-in-transkribus/).

Using a model on letters gives a more complete transcription to correct, rather than having to transcribe the letter from scratch, though transcribing from scratch is still an option.
1. (To transcribe manually, skip to step 4.) To transcribe with the HTR model, click on the Tools tab, and under Text Recognition, select the model called “Pauline Smith 2.0.” You might have to navigate to the next page to find the Pauline Smith model.

![htr step 1 screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/htr-step1.png)

![htr step 2 screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/htr-step2.png)

2. Click Run. The HTR analysis may take anywhere from 20 seconds to 2 minutes. A notification that the “job” is done will pop up when analysis is complete. From there, correct the transcription.
3. Transcribe each page as you see it, following Transkribus transcription guidelines. You may have a few errors on a page or there may be significant errors. It depends on several things - the quality of the scan, the quality of the document, the handwriting and what utensil they used, etc.!
4. To transcribe manually, use the layout analysis to begin typing each line as it’s written. You can use the enter key to move to each line. Moving to the next page will prompt you to save your work.

![htr corrections example screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/htr-corrections-example.png)

5. After you've completed editing the transcription, go back over the letter, making sure you didn't miss typos, and you can simultaneously begin tagging the document, which will be explained in the next lesson! Don’t forget to track your progress!
## Check-in
What does HTR stand for?

True or false - HTR replaces our need to transcribe documents at all.

Discuss: what do you do if you haven’t trained an HTR model in Transkribus? 

# 4. Metadata Tags
Tagging, annotating, or marking-up a document is a common practice for text analysis. Why is this? Think about the things someone might talk to you about in a letter. They might mention people they talked about, places they went, or a book they read. Now think about the contents of 6,000 letters, and all of this information together! Tagging will allow us to use the information in the collection of thousands of letters to track these trends over time, explore topics, and find people.

Think of tagging the letter like highlighting categories of information with a different color highlighter. All of the people's names are blue, the places are purple, etc. Transkribus does the same thing.
## Categories of metadata tags
It is tempting to tag everything, but not necessary! You only need to tag:
1. Proper nouns (e.g. people, places, or organizations)
2. When you add something for clarity that isn't there originally (e.g. "[illegible]").
3. If you want to provide further information as context.

## Metadata tags, defined.
As a group, you will need to decide which tags you’ll use, and what their definitions will be.. Examples of tags and definitions that already exist in Transkribus include:
1. person - when any person’s name is mentioned within the body of the letter (e.g. “Daddy,” Martha, Gilbert, etc.). You can also decide to tag people without names, i.e. “girl,” or “baby.”
2. place - when a place name is mentioned within the body of the letter. This does not usually include general places like Sunday school or hospital. Examples would be town names like Bruce or Memphis. 
3. organization - a specific group, corporation, or entity (e.g. the Senate, the T.V.A., or Ole Miss), not a generic place like hospital or school.
4. sic - for an error in the original letter (i.e. spelling, grammar, etc.) that you include it in the transcript for accuracy, tag it with “sic,” showing that it’s “as is,” and you didn’t make the error in transcribing.
5. date - a specific date (e.g. January 15th, 1948). This does not include general references to days of the week or years (e.g. “Saturday nite” or “next year.”)
6. unclear - when you write something in the transcription, but aren’t sure of what it actually says in the letter: a guess.
7. gap - when you include something (i.e. [illegible], a note, etc.) that isn’t in the original letter to give clarity, but to prevent the HTR from picking up the note.

Depending on what’s in your collection, you may also decide to create custom tags. For the examples in this lesson, we used a collection of correspondence, and in order to track who was sending letters, who was receiving them, where they were coming from and where they were going to, we created the following custom tags:
1. sender - The person who sent the letter, either in the return address, or in the letter’s closing.
2. recipient - The person the letter is addressed to, either on the envelope, or in the salutation.
3. address - The address the letter was sent to.
4. return-address - the address the letter came from (not always included)
5. title - the title of a book, play, radio show, government decision, etc. Anything that is published, for example. Specifications may include full title, author, and publication date.

## How to tag something
1. To tag something, highlight the text you want to tag, right-click, and from “All tags,” select the relevant tag.

![tag screenhot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/tag-screenshot.png)

2. If the tag isn’t in the list, go to the metadata menu, then the Textual menu, and click Customize.
![customize tag screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/customize-tag.JPG)
3. Click “Create new tag,” then type in the name of the tag, lowercase, like it’s shown in the Tag definitions document.
![create new tag screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/create-new-tag.JPG)
## Check-in
Tags are tricky! Let's discuss some different scenarios.

Scenario 1: You are tagging a document that says, “We went to a football game between Louisiana State University and Texas A&M.” Would you tag the two universities as places or organizations?

Scenario 2: If a document mentions a fictional person, do you tag them with “person”?

Scenario 3: What do you tag [illegible] with?

Scenario 4: What is a scenario where a person or place is mentioned, but you might not tag them?

Scenario 5: What’s an example of a time you might use the comment tag?

Discuss: Does your collection warrant specific tags? Think about what you’d like to track or analyze, and list custom tags that would create points of connection for later analyses of the collection.

As a reminder, there is a video of transcribing a letter from beginning to end, which you can watch as a refresher: https://youtu.be/-cDD9P0rnLw.
# 5. Exporting files in Transkribus
After you have transcribed (or corrected a transcription of) a letter, tagged it, and proofread it, it has been digitally transformed, and we can now use the transcriptions and metadata to create visualizations through text analysis, network analysis, and more! But before you can do that, you have to export the files.

Before the step-by-step, we recommend watching the [3-minute video](https://youtu.be/k21t3jGL4LM.) on this process. 
## Export
Click the export button (a manila folder with a green, right-facing arrow), and you will choose the following files to export:
- .docx - to give you a formatted version of the transcript
- .txt - to give a non-formatted version of the transcript, and create a file that is more universally accessible, both to text readers, and to text analysis softwares.
- .xlsx (tag export) - to give you structured lists of the tags you created

_If you would like to export more than one document, select the radio button that says "Current Collection," and choose which letters to export._

![export screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/export.JPG)

## Extract zipped files
When you click OK, Transkribus emails you a temporary link where you can access the compressed files you just created. Compressing them allows them to send large amounts of data over email. When you click the link, it will ask you to save the compressed files (.zip).

![extract files 1 screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/extract-files-1.JPG)

Saving them as compressed files stores them to your computer, but does not let you access them until you extract them. Right-click your compressed folder and click Extract All... then tell your computer where you want to extract them to. I recommend saving them to a folder where you're keeping files for this class. (We will also store them on a cloud server, e.g. Google Drive or our Institutional Repository at some point.)

![extract files 2 screenshot](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/DLFTeachToolkit3/blob/main/transcribing-images/extract-files-2.JPG)

After you extract the files, you should notice that your folder no longer has a zipper on it, and you have 3 files that represent digital versions of the letter you prepared. You are now ready to start playing with these digital artifacts!
